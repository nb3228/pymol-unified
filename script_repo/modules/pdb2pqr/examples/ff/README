This directory contains a basic example of a user defined 
force field and names files for PDB2PQR. These are based on the
AMBER force field and AMBER names.

To use a new force field run pdb2pqr with the following command line:

python pdb2pqr.py --userff=userff.dat --usernames=usernames.names 1a1p test.pqr

Replace userff.dat and usernames.names with your own files.

When specifying a user defined force field you must always specify a user 
defined names file. A names file may be specified with a standard 
force field.

For more info on how to create names and force field files see the 
user's guide and programmer's guide.
