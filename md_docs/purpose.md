# Statement of Purpose

This site exists to provide an _exclusive_ benefit to PyMOL sponsors in the form of current, official, and definitive information on the executable builds and source code maintained by Schrödinger. However, it is not intended to supplant or replace the community-maintained [PyMOL Wiki](http://www.pymolwiki.org "http://www.pymolwiki.org"). Indeed, the information found on PyMOLWiki is sometimes richer and more useful than what you will find here, though it may also be obsolete or even incorrect. 

In order to get the most from PyMOL, we encourage you to make regular use of both resources.
