## CavitOmiX 1.0

CavitOmiX plugin for Schrodinger’s PyMOL, a nifty tool that allows you to analyze protein cavities from any input structure. You can now dive deep into your proteins, cavities, and binding sites using crystal structures and state-of-the-art AI models from OpenFold (powered by NVIDIA’s BioNeMo service), DeepMind`s AlphaFold and ESMFold by Meta. Even more exciting: just enter any protein sequence and you will get the structure predicted by OpenFold or ESMFold loaded into your PyMOL within seconds.

  * Catalophore™ Cavities can be calculated for molecules loaded in PyMOL
  * Predict protein structures within seconds for any protein sequence using [OpenFold](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/bionemo) by NVIDIA [BioNeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/bionemo) (coming soon!) and [ESMFold by Meta](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/protein-folding-esmfold-metagenomics/)
  * [AlphaFold](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold) models can be retrieved via [UniProt ID](https://www.uniprot.org/)
  * Analyze the hydrophobicity of your Catalophore™ cavities
  * Protein structures can be retrieved from the [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) using the PDB code
  * Mix and match all the above in a single entry, align the structures and get a quick overview
  * Catalophore™ cavity calculation settings can be changed
  * Each [Catalophore™ cavity](https://innophore.com) is an "residue" entry and each cavity point is an "atom", so you can select, remove, copy, represent cavities to your liking!
