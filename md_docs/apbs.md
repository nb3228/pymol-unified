# The APBS Plugin

PyMOL builds usually include a copy of a plugin for APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver). This plugin was written by Michael George Lerner and [APBS itself](http://apbs.sourceforge.net "http://apbs.sourceforge.net") is an open-source project run by Nathan A. Baker. 

Currently, this plugin is not officially supported, though it is expected to become a supported feature during the lifetime of the 1.x release series. 

[More Information about APBS](http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/APBS "http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/APBS") can be found on the PyMOL Wiki.
