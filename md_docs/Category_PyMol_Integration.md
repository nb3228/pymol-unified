This page describes how to use the [Computational Crystallography Toolbox (cctbx)](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project) with PyMOL. 

cctbx and PyMOL need to be compiled with the same Python distribution, otherwise they won't be compatible. 

### Incentive PyMOL

Create a [conda](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/) environment with [schrodinger::pymol](https://anaconda.org/schrodinger/pymol) and [conda-forge::cctbx-base](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cctbx-base). 

On Linux and Windows: 
    
    
    conda create -n env1 schrodinger::pymol conda-forge::cctbx-base
    

On macOS, you also need [schrodinger::tk](https://anaconda.org/schrodinger/pymol) and [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/): 
    
    
    conda create -n env1 schrodinger::pymol conda-forge::cctbx-base schrodinger::tk
    

### Open-Source PyMOL

## Overview

**nuccyl** is a [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) program that allows [PyMOL](http://www.pymol.org/), a powerful open-source molecular modeling system, to display atomic models of nucleic acids in a highly simplified representation. By depicting the nucleic acid backbone as a cartoon and the bases of nucleotides as cylinders, similarly to the excellent programs [Ribbons](http://sgce.cbse.uab.edu/ribbons/) and [Drawna](http://www-ibmc.u-strasbg.fr/upr9002/westhof/download.html), nuccyl and PyMOL allow to quickly grasp the overall folding of an RNA or DNA molecule

Example Nuccyl IV

nuccyl produces base cylinder coordinates and command files to display them with PyMOL. The base pair analysis programs [RNAView](http://beta-ndb.rutgers.edu/services/download/index.html#rnaview) and [3DNA](http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/%7exiangjun/3DNA/) can also be optionally used to obtain starting input files for nuccyl. 

[RNAView](http://beta-ndb.rutgers.edu/services/download/index.html#rnaview) can be downloaded and installed as [described](http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/services/help/rnaview-readme.html); a [publication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12824344&dopt=Abstract) describing the program is also available. Information and download links for [3DNA](http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/%7exiangjun/3DNA/) may be found at the program's [home page](http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/%7exiangjun/3DNA/); a [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12930962&dopt=Abstract) has also been published.
