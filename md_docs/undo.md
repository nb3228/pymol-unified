# Undo

As of version 1.1, PyMOL does not have a functioning general purpose undo, though this capability is planned. The only undo functions which presently work are: 

  * reversal of conformational changes made to molecules (“Undo Conformation” in the Edit menu).

  * text editing functions in MacPyMOL, when using the upper command entry field.
