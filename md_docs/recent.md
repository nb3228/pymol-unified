# Recent Enhancements

PyMOL development is fundamentally driven by user, sponsor, and collaborators. These days, almost all progress is the result of one or more requests, and in some cases, major enhancements have even been specifically paid for through sponsored development arrangements. 

So if you want to see something particular in future PyMOL versions, please send your ideas to [help@schrodinger.com](mailto:mailto:help@schrodinger.com?subject=PyMOL%20Feature%20Request "mailto:help@schrodinger.com?subject=PyMOL%20Feature%20Request") or put your suggestion on the [Ideas Page](http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Ideas "http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Ideas") of the PyMOL Community Wiki. 

## Planned Features (future releases)

  * [Undo](/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=undo "undo") of user interface actions, including molecular building.

  * Visual interface to key-framing object motion

  * Direct output to MPEG video (cross-platform)




## Pending Features (<6 months)

  * Scene buttons: clickable & enable visual resorting of scene

  * compressed session files (`set session_compression`).

  * per-atom and per-bond settings

  * group objects




## PyMOL 0.99

Listed in order of decreasing utility or impact (best stuff first).
