Tranformation matrices can be transferred from one object to another using the [matrix_copy](/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=command:matrix_copy "command:matrix_copy") command. For example, after superimposing a one protein object on to another, one might also want to apply that same transformation to an object containing the associated ligand and/or solvent atoms.
