The movie-making process currently involves three main steps: 

  1. [Drafting](/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=movie:draft "movie:draft") structure and content for the movie. 

  2. [Producing](/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=movie:produce "movie:produce") an image file for each individual frame.

  3. [Compressing](/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=movie:compress "movie:compress") the many image files into a single movie file.




One of the advantages of [MacPyMOL](/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=macpymol "macpymol") as compared to Open-Source, Linux, or Windows PyMOL is that it can perform the second and third steps automatically.
